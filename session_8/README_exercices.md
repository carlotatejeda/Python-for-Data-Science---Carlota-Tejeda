# Exercise 8

# Overview

This project involves creating visualizations and performing data analysis using Python libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. The exercises focus on generating insights from datasets using various types of plots and statistical calculations.

# Type of plots used
1. Lineplot to visualize how study time varies by student name using a lineplot.

2. Histogram to plot a histogram of grades to determine which grade range has the highest frequency.

3. ECDF plot to generate an ECDF plot to show the cumulative distribution of grades.

4. Stripplot to v isualize grade distribution across courses using a stripplot.

5. Swarmplot to display the relationship between gender and study time using a swarmplot.

6. Pointplot to plot the average grade for each course using a pointplot.

# Libraries used
Pandas: Data manipulation and preprocessing.

Seaborn: Advanced visualizations.

Matplotlib: Customizing plot appearance.
