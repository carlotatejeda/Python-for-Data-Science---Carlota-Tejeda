# Session 5 Exercises

# Overview

This project analyzes a collection of annotation files stored in a folder, each with a specific naming convention. The goal was to gather insights from these files, such as the total count, files following a specified format, monthly distribution, and unique identifiers. Each file is structured with specific fields, including date, time, satellite number, version, and a unique region code.

# Objectives

The main objectives of this project were:

1. Determine the number of annotation files in the folder.
2. Identify files following the specified naming convention.
3. Count the number of annotations per month and year and determine which month has the most annotation files.
4. Create a dictionary where each key is a month, and the corresponding value is a list containing all annotation names whose dates correspond to that month.
- Save the dictionary in JSON format and load it to verify accuracy.
- Save the dictionary using Pickle.
- Instead of storing just the annotation names, create a dictionary for each annotation with keys: name and date (using a datetime object).
5. Print all annotations from the oldest to the newest during the second half of 2024.

The solution was implemented step-by-step in Python, using standard libraries such as os, glob, re, json, and pickle for file handling and data manipulation.
