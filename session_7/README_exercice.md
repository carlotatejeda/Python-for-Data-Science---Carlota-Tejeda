# Exercice session 7

# Overview

This project focuses on handling missing data and performing various data transformation tasks using Python and the Pandas library.

Different exerices: 

- Extract professor initials
Create a new column (professor_initials) that stores the initials of each professor's first and last names using string manipulation.

- Combine datasets
Use join to merge a dataset containing professors' information (department and age) with another dataset containing courses taught by each professor, based on the professor's name.

- Perform a full outer merge
Combine the professor information dataset with the courses dataset using a full outer merge to ensure all rows are included, regardless of matches.

- Reorganize columns
Extract first_name and last_name from the professor column and rearrange them so that these new columns appear immediately after the professor column.

We have:
- Used lambda functions for string manipulation and creating new columns.
- Performed various types of merges and join methods.
- Splitted string data into multiple columns.
