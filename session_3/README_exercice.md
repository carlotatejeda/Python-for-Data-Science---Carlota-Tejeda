# Session 4 Exercises

# Overview

This project involves designing a course registration system using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The goal was to create different classes to manage students, courses, and registrations, making it easier to handle tasks like enrolling in courses, listing whoâ€™s in each course, and even assigning grades.

# Objectives

The main objectives of this project were:

- Course class:
Define a Course class where each course has a name, description, and a list of enrolled students.
Implement methods to add, remove, and display all students in the course.

- Student class:
Define a Student class where each student has a name, ID number, address, and a list of enrolled courses.
Implement methods to enroll in a course, drop a course, and display all courses a student is registered in.

- Registration class:
Define a Registration class to manage a list of students and courses.
Implement methods to add students and courses to the system, enroll a student in a course, drop a student from a course, and display all students and courses.

- Course with grades class:
Extend functionality by adding grades for each student in their enrolled courses.
Create a method to assign grades and retrieve a student's GPA based on their grades in each course.
